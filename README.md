# Remote Fire Control System

The **Remote Fire Control System** project is designed to receive wireless commands via an ESP8266 module. Based on these commands, the system can:

- Rotate a pan-tilt setup using two Nema-17 stepper motors in 8 specific directions:
  - North
  - North-Northeast
  - Northeast
  - East-Northeast
  - East
  - East-Southeast
  - Southeast
  - South-Southeast
- Fire Nerf Rival balls using two DC motors.
- Operate in two firing modes:
  - **AutoFire Mode:** Utilizes a servo motor and two limit switches for reloading and firing the Nerf Rival balls.
  - **SingleFire Mode:** Shoots one ball at a time.
